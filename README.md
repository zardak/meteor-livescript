[LiveScript](http://livescript.net/) is a language which compiles to JavaScript. It has a straightforward mapping to JavaScript and allows you to write expressive code devoid of repetitive boilerplate. While LiveScript adds many features to assist in functional style programming, it also has many improvements for object oriented and imperative programming.
LiveScript is a fork of Coco and an indirect descendant of CoffeeScript, with which it has much compatibility.
